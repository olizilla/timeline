videos + slides = presentation

This proof of concept shows how to script an HTML5 player so it can be used as
part of an online presentation app.

Slides have an associated start time; as the video plays, the slides appear next
to the video, when the video time matches the slide start time.

The current demo allows you to grab slides from the video using the 's' key.
Clicking on the slide will jump you to that time in the video. 
Let the video play from the beginning and the slides will display when the 
associated video time is reached.
